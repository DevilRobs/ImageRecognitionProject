<photo  date_taken="2006-11-09 05:54:10" description="The Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences (originally to have been called The Central Hall of Arts and Sciences but changed by Queen Victoria when laying the foundation stone at the very last minute) is an arts venue dedicated to Queen Victoria&amp;apos;s husband and consort, Prince Albert. It forms the practical part of a national memorial to the Prince Consort - the decorative part is the &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg298037756&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Albert Memorial&amp;lt;a&amp;gt; directly to the north. The hall also accommodates the largest pipe organ in the UK, and is the home of The Proms. The Hall, affectionately titled &amp;amp;quot;The Nation&amp;apos;s Village Hall&amp;amp;quot;, hosts the Proms every summer since they were bombed out of the Queen&amp;apos;s Hall in 1941, used for classical and rock concerts, conferences, ballroom dancing, poetry recitals, education, ballet, opera and even a circus (Cirque du Soleil). It has hosted many sporting events, including boxing, wrestling (including the first Sumo wrestling tournament ever to be held outside Japan) and tennis. It also hosts the annual Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance, held the day before Remembrance Sunday. The hall, a Grade I listed building, is oval in shape, measuring 83 m (272 feet) by 72 m (238 feet) around the outside, and has a capacity of 8,000 people and has accommodated as many as 9,000 (safety restrictions now allow a maximum capacity of 5,544 including standing in the Gallery). The great glass and wrought-iron dome roofing the hall is 41 m (135 feet) high. Around the outside of the hall is a great terra cotta frieze, depicting &amp;amp;quot;The Triumph of Arts and Sciences&amp;amp;quot;, in reference to the hall&amp;apos;s dedication. One-foot high letters above the frieze have the Biblical quotations: &amp;amp;quot;Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is - in the heaven and in the earth is Thine. ... The wise and their works are in the hand of God. ... Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace.&amp;amp;quot; The Hall was designed by Captain Francis Fowke and Colonel H.Y. Darracott Scott of the Royal Engineers. They were heavily influenced by ancient amphitheatres, but had also been exposed to the ideas of Gottfried Semper. The Hall was constructed mainly of Fareham Red brick, with terra cotta block decoration made by Gibbs and Canning Ltd. of Tamworth. The dome, designed by Rowland Mason Ordish,was made of steel and glazed. There was a trial assembly made of the steel framework of the dome in Manchester, then it was taken apart again and transported down to London via horse and cart. When the time came for the supporting structure to be removed, only volunteers remained on site in case the structure dropped. It did drop - but only by 58&amp;amp;quot;. In 1851 the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, led Prince Albert, the Prince Consort, to propose that a permanent series of facilities be built in the area for the enlightenment of the public. Progress on the scheme was slow and in 1861 Prince Albert died, without having seen his ideas come to fruition. However, a memorial was proposed for Hyde Park, with a Great Hall opposite. In April 1867 Queen Victoria signed the Royal Charter and in May, laid the foundation stone. The official opening ceremony of the Royal Albert Hall was on March 29, 1871. After a welcoming speech by Edward, the Prince of Wales, Queen Victoria was too overcome to speak, so the Prince had to announce that &amp;amp;quot;The Queen declares this Hall is now open&amp;amp;quot;. A concert followed, when the Hall&amp;apos;s acoustic problems became immediately apparent. These were addressed in 1969 when a series of large fibreglass acoustic diffusing discs (commonly referred to as &amp;amp;quot;mushrooms&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;flying saucers&amp;amp;quot;) were installed in the roof to cut down echo. Initially lit by gas, electric lighting was installed in 1897. In 1936, the hall was the scene of a giant rally celebrating the British Empire, the occasion being the centenary of Joseph Chamberlain&amp;apos;s birth. The hall is primarily used as a live music venue. Some famous concerts include the only bill to feature both the Beatles and The Rolling Stones in 1963, Cream&amp;apos;s farewell show, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Andrew Lloyd Weber&amp;apos;s 50th birthday celebration, and the Les Miserables &amp;amp;quot;Dream Cast&amp;amp;quot; 10th Anniversary performance. One that it didn&amp;apos;t hold was Bob Dylan&amp;apos;s widely bootlegged May 17, 1966 concert, mistakingly labeled as being in Royal Albert Hall.

<photo  date_taken="2012-05-30 13:56:54" description="The Albert Memorial Clock is a tall clock tower situated at Queen&amp;apos;s Square in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was completed in 1869 and is one of the best known landmarks of Belfast. In 1865 a competition for the design of a memorial to Queen Victoria&amp;apos;s late Prince Consort, Prince Albert, was won by W. J. Barre, who had earlier designed Belfast&amp;apos;s Ulster Hall. Initially Barre was not awarded his prize and the contract was secretly given to Lanyon, Lynn, and Lanyon, who had come second. Following public outcry the contract was eventually awarded to Barre. The construction cost of Â£2,500 (2011: Â£181,000) was raised by public subscription. The sandstone memorial was constructed between 1865 and 1869 by Fitzpatrick Brothers builders and stands 113 feet tall in a mix of French and Italian Gothic styles. The base of the tower features flying buttresses with heraldic lions. A statue of the Prince in the robes of a Knight of the Garter stands on the western side of the tower and was sculpted by SF Lynn.

As a result of being built on wooden piles on marshy, reclaimed land around the River Farset, the top of the tower leans four feet off the perpendicular. Due to this movement, some ornamental work on the belfry was removed in 1924 along with a stone canopy over the statue of the Prince. Being situated close to the docks, the tower was once infamous for being frequented by prostitutes plying their trade with visiting sailors. However, in recent years regeneration has turned the surrounding Queen&amp;apos;s Square and Custom&amp;apos;s House Square into attractive, modern public spaces with trees, fountains and sculptures." id="7315677238" latitude="54.600902" license="5" longitude="-5.923926" nbComments="1" rank="213" tags="unitedkingdom belfast northernireland infomatique belfastbyinfomatique statuesinfomatique" title="The Albert Memorial Clock is a tall clock tower situated at Queen&amp;apos;s Square in Belfast" url_b="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7218/7315677238_802b075b53_b.jpg" username="infomatique" userid="80824546@N00" views="340" />

Built on land reclaimed from the River Lagan, the &amp;amp;quot;Albert Clock&amp;amp;quot; features a statue of Prince Albert as well as ornately carved crowned lions and floral decorations." id="5688007309" latitude="0" license="5" longitude="0" nbComments="0" rank="218" tags="city uk ireland europe belfast northern williammurphy infomatique belfastcity streetsofbelfast belfastbyinfomatique statuesinfomatique" title="Albert Memorial Clock -  Belfastâs answer to Pisaâs leaning tower" url_b="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5688007309_3dcd5871b3_b.jpg" username="infomatique" userid="80824546@N00" views="156" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-10-31 08:46:56" description="The standing portrait statue of Albert Gallatin, executed by sculptor James Earle Fraser and architect Henry Bacon, was completed in 1941 and dedicated in front of the &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg136352684&amp;quot;&amp;gt;north entrance to the Department of Treasury Building&amp;lt;a&amp;gt; on October 15, 1947. The memorial was authorized by Congress on January 11, 1927 and responsibility for the installation of the memorial was placed with the Albert Gallatin Memorial Fund Commission. By 1934 enough funds had been raised, but the memorial was delayed by the U.S. Fine Arts Commission&amp;apos;s approval of a suitable model. By the time the model was ready to be cast, WWII had created a ban on the non-war use of bronze. Before installation in the north courtyard, a fountain had to be removed. Albert Gallatin (1761-1849) arrived in Cape Ann, Massachusetts in 1780 from his native Switzerland and later settled in Pennsylvania where he was elected a member of the State Legislature. He went on to be elected to the U.S. Senate and later the House of Representatives where he served on the new Standing Committee of Finance. Gallatin&amp;apos;s interest in the fiscal operation of the U.S. Government led President Jefferson to offer him the post of Secretary of the Treasury in 1801. Within six years, Gallatin was not only able to see that the U.S. debt of fourteen million dollars was paid off, but also that a surplus of funds was created. Gallatin was again offered the position of Secretary of the Treasury in 1916 by President Madison and in 1843 by President Tyler, but declined. He went on to negotiate the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812, and serve as Minister both to France and to England before retiring from government service. He then moved to New York where he became the president of the National Bank of the City of New York. He later became a founder of New York University and the American Ethnological Society. The United States Department of the Treasury Building, at 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, is the third oldest building in Washington, dating from 1836. Robert Mills was commissioned to design the T-shaped Greek Revival building after the two previous structures had burned down. The Department of Treasury, established by an Act of U.S. Congress in 1789 to manage the revenue of the United States government, prints and mints all paper currency and coins in circulation through the &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg3642167963&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Bureau of Engraving&amp;lt;a&amp;gt; and Printing and the &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg2564490354&amp;quot;&amp;gt;United States Mint&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;. Alexander Hamilton, of whom &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg3643080789&amp;quot;&amp;gt;a statue stands on the south wing&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;, was sworn in as the first Secretary of the Treasury on September 11, 1789. The Department of Treasury moved into a porticoed Gregorian-style building, designed by George Hadfield in 1800 when the federal government moved from Philadelphia. The structure was destroyed by the British in 1814, but rebuilt by James Hobson. It was again burned, this time by arsonists in 1833, with only the fireproof wing left standing. Three years later, on July 4, 1836, Congress authorized construction of a new East and Center Wings. The most architecturally impressive feature of the Mills design is the 341-foot long colonnade of thirty 36-foot tall columns carved out of a single block of granite. The material for the original Wing was Acquia Creek freestone, which was largely replaced with granite in 1908. The interior design of the east and center wings is classically austere, in keeping with the Greek Revival style. In 1855, Congress granted authority to extend the building. Construction of what is now the &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg3643887436&amp;quot;&amp;gt;South Wing&amp;lt;a&amp;gt; was begun in July 1855 and completed and occupied in September 1861. Construction started on the west wing in 1855 and was completed and occupied in 1864. The preliminary design of the wings was provided by Thomas Ustick Walter, but construction began under the supervision of Ammi B. Young and from 1862 until 1867 by Isaiah Rogers. While the exterior of the building was executed along the lines of the original Mills wings, the interiors of the later wings reflect changes in both building technology and aesthetic tastes. Iron columns and beams reinforced the building&amp;apos;s brick vaults, and the architectural detailing became much more ornate, following mid-nineteenth century fashion. The final addition came in 1867 in the form of the North Wing, which displaced the Department of State Building. Designed by Alfred B. Mullett, the wing contains the Cash Room, opened in 1869 as the site of Ulysses S. Grant&amp;apos;s Inaugural Ball. It is a two-story marble hall in which the daily financial business was transacted. The Attic story, now the Treasury Building&amp;apos;s fifth floor, was added in 1910. A statue of Albert Gallatin, the 4th and longest serving Secretary, sits on the North Patio. Lafayette Square Historic District, roughly bordered by 15th and 17th Sts. and H St. and State and Treasury Places, exclusive of the White House and its grounds, covers the seven-acre public park, Lafayette Square, and its surrounding structures including the Executive Office Building, Blair House, the Treasury Building, the Decatur House, and St. John&amp;apos;s Episcopal Church.

<photo  date_taken="2011-04-28 16:53:34" description="The buildings and structures of Belfast comprise many styles of architecture ranging from Edwardian through to state-of-the-art modern buildings like the Waterfront Hall. The city&amp;apos;s beautiful Edwardian buildings are notable for their display of large numbers of sculptures. Many of Belfast&amp;apos;s Victorian landmarks, including the main Lanyon Building at Queens University in 1849, were designed by Sir Charles Lanyon. The City Hall, was finished in 1906 and was built to reflect Belfastâs City status, granted by Queen Victoria in 1888. The Dome is 53 metres (173 ft) high. Figures above the door are âHibernia encouraging and promoting the Commerce and Arts of the Cityâ. Among the city&amp;apos;s grandest buildings are two former banks: Ulster Bank (1860), in Waring Street and Northern Bank (1769), in nearby Donegall Street. The Royal Courts of Justice in Chichester Street are home to Northern Ireland&amp;apos;s Supreme Court. Some of Belfast&amp;apos;s oldest buildings still remain in the Cathedral Quarter area, which is currently undergoing redevelopment as the city&amp;apos;s main cultural and tourist area. The world&amp;apos;s largest dry dock is located in the city, and the giant cranes (Samson and Goliath) of the Harland and Wolff shipyard, builders of the Titanic, can be seen from afar. The four star Europa Hotel, located in the City Centre, was bombed twenty-seven times during the troubles and is among one of the most bombed hotels in Europe. Across the street, the ornately decorated Crown Liquor Saloon in Great Victoria Street is notable as being the only bar owned by the National Trust. The panels used in the restaurant on the first floor were meant for Brittanic, the sister ship of the Titanic. It was made internationally famous as the setting for the classic film, Odd Man Out, starring James Mason. Belfast also contains the tallest building (as distinct from structure) on the island of Ireland. Windsor House stands at 80 metres (262 ft) and has twenty-three floors. Once completed, the Obel Tower will surpass Windsor House, although a taller building than this has been given planning permission in Dublin. In January 2007 plans were submitted to build the Aurora Tower on Great Victoria Street, which will be 37 storeys high. At 109m (358 ft) high it will house 290 luxury apartments and be 28m (92 ft) higher than the Obel Tower. The Albert Clock stands at the end of High Street, and was designed by William J. Barre and built in memory of Queen Victoria&amp;apos;s Prince Consort, Prince Albert. The clock stands 35 m high, was built on land reclaimed from the river, and leans 1.25 m off the vertical. The Linen Hall Library in Donegall Square North is Belfastâs oldest library, founded in 1788 to acquire &amp;apos;philosophical apparatus and such productions of nature and art as are calculated to enlarge knowledge&amp;apos;. St George&amp;apos;s Market, built between 1890 and 1896, is Belfast&amp;apos;s last surviving Victorian covered market. It was restored at a cost of Â£4.5 million in 1997, and hosts regular Friday and Saturday markets. Near the Market is Saint Malachy&amp;apos;s Catholic Church. Built between 1841 and 1844, it is built in the Tudor Revival style and is unique in Ireland. It is also one of only two buildings remaining in Belfast which was constructed with hand-made bricks. Hamilton Street is a Georgian terrace in the Markets Area, originally built in the 1830s, which was restored in 1988 by Hearth. Belfast has several venues for performing arts. The Grand Opera House was completed in 1895 was bombed several times during the Troubles but has been restored to its former glory. The Ulster Hall (1859-1862) was originally designed for grand dances but is now used primarily as a concert and sporting venue. Lloyd George, Parnell and Patrick Pearse all attended political rallies there. It holds 13 paintings of Belfast History. The Mulholland organ costing 3000 guineas was donated and named after a local wealthy industrialist. The Waterfront Hall was opened in 1997 as part of the redevelopment of the Laganside and already has become an icon of modern Belfast.

It features a bareheaded soldier in uniform who stands on a pedestal with bowed head and arms reversed. It has been said that the soldier seems to be musing on those killed in the war. At his feet is a helmet. On the four sides of the pedestal are bronze plaques with the names of the dead. Those relating to the men killed in the second World War have Staffordshire knots at their bases. The Stone War Memorial was unveiled by the Earl of Dartmouth on the 10th January 1921.

Niehaus&amp;apos;s twelve-foot bronze doors at the south entrance feature six demi-relief panels, each depicting a scene in the history of Manhattan and the Trinity Church: Hendrik Hudson on the Half moon Discovering Manhattan Island; Dr. Barclay Preaching to the Indians; Washington Entering St. Paul&amp;apos;s Chapel after his Inauguration as President; The Consecration of Four Bishop&amp;apos;s in St. Paul&amp;apos;s Chapel; Consecration of Trinity Church; and The Dedication of the Astor Reredos. Trinity Church, prominently located at the terminus of Wall Street at 79 Broadway, is the oldest Episcopal church in New York City, having been consecrated on Ascension Day May 1, 1846. Designed by architect Richard Upjohn, Trinity is considered a classic example of Gothic Revival architecture. At the time of its completion, the 281-foot spire was the highest point in New York until being surpassed in 1890 by the New York World Building. The Trinity Church parish received its initial charter from King William III of England in 1697. The first Trinity Church building, a modest rectangular structure with a gambrel roof and small porch was constructed in 1698. The building was destroyed in the Great New York City Fire of 1776, in the early days of the military occupation by the British during the American Revolutionary War. Construction on the second building began in 1788, which was consecrated in 1790 and then torn down after being weakened by severe snows during the winter of 1838â39. By the early 1840&amp;apos;s, the church&amp;apos;s expanding parish had split. The newly formed parish would build Grace Church, to the north on Broadway at 10th street, while the original parish would re-build the Trinity that stands today. Upjohn designed the new Church in Neo-Gothic fashion, complete with sandstone and stained-glass windows--two features unheard of at the time. Adorned with Gothic spires and pointed arches, and sporting a very linear upward-appearing exterior, the design reflected &amp;amp;quot;High Church&amp;amp;quot; fashion, at odds with contemporary Protestant &amp;amp;quot;Low Church&amp;amp;quot; thought. As a compromise, the side walls were kept simple, without the flying buttresses predominant in most Gothic structures. The adjoining Trinity Churchyard Cemetery, opened in 1697, is one of three separate burial grounds that make up the non-denominational Trinity Church Cemetery (the others being the &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg152447742&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Churchyard of St. Paul&amp;apos;s Chapel&amp;lt;a&amp;gt; and the Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum at the Chapel of Intercession).

He went on to be elected to the U.S. Senate and later the House of Representatives where he served on the new Standing Committee of Finance. Gallatin&amp;apos;s interest in the fiscal operation of the U.S. Government led President Jefferson to offer him the post of Secretary of the Treasury in 1801. Within six years, Gallatin was not only able to see that the U.S. debt of fourteen million dollars was paid off, but also that a surplus of funds was created. Gallatin was again offered the position of Secretary of the Treasury in 1916 by President Madison and in 1843 by President Tyler, but declined. He went on to negotiate the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812, and serve as Minister both to France and to England before retiring from government service. He then moved to New York where he became the president of the National Bank of the City of New York.

Gore House, with its three-acre (12,000 mÂ²) estate, was the residence of William Wilberforce between 1808 and 1821, and was occupied by the Countess of Blessington and the Count D&amp;apos;Orsay from 1836 to 1849. In May 1851, the house was opened as a restaurant by the chef Alexis Soyer, who planned to cater for the Great Exhibition of 1851. After the exhibition, Gore House and its land were bought by the Royal Commissioners for the Exhibition. &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiKensington_Gore&amp;quot; rel&amp;quot;nofollow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiKensington_Gore&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;" id="3764183351" latitude="0" license="2" longitude="0" nbComments="3" rank="289" tags="london kodak hawkeye kensington browniehawkeyeflash kodakthanksforallthegreatcamerasandthanksforallthefilmthatisyourtruelegacytotheworldnotthedigitalstuff" title="Royal Albert Hall seen from Kensington Gore" url_b="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3475/3764183351_14bee9da38_b.jpg" username="seriykotik1970" userid="71092566@N00" views="268" />

<photo  date_taken="2011-04-28 15:42:23" description="The Albert Memorial Clock is a tall clock tower situated at Queen&amp;apos;s Square in Belfast. It was completed in 1869 and is one of the best known landmarks of Belfast. As a result of being built on wooden piles on marshy, reclaimed land around the River Farset, the top of the tower leans four feet off the perpendicular. Due to this movement, some ornamental work on the belfry was removed in 1924 along with a stone canopy over the statue of the Prince. Being situated close to the docks, the tower was once infamous for being frequented by prostitutes plying their trade with visiting sailors. However, in recent years regeneration has turned the surrounding Queen&amp;apos;s Square and Custom&amp;apos;s House Square into attractive, modern public spaces with trees, fountains and sculptures. To halt the worsening lean and repair damage caused by the elements and heavy passing traffic, a multi-million pound restoration project was completed in 2002. During the project the wooden foundations were strengthened, the majority of the decaying carvings were replaced and the entire tower was cleaned.
