<photo  date_taken="2010-08-01 09:58:54" description="The Aztec Ruins National Monument preserves ancestral Pueblo structures in north-western New Mexico, United States, located close to the town of Aztec and northeast of Farmington, near the Animas River. Salmon Ruins and Heritage Park, with more ancestral Pueblo structures, lies a short distance to the south, just west of Bloomfield near the San Juan River. The buildings date back to the 11th to 13th centuries, and the misnomer attributing them to the Aztec civilization can be traced back to early American settlers in the mid-19th century. The actual construction was by the ancestral Puebloans, the Anasazi. The site was declared &amp;amp;quot;Aztec Ruin National Monument&amp;amp;quot; on January 24, 1923, and with a boundary change it was renamed &amp;amp;quot;Ruins&amp;amp;quot; on July 2, 1928. As an historical property of the National Park Service the National Monument was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Aztec Ruins was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, as part of the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, on December 8, 1987. Anasazi settlements in North America started during the late 11th century and ran until around 1300. The Anasazi are believed to most likely have moved from these ruins into neighboring areas such as the present day Hopi and Navajo reserves and the pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. These relocations occurred due to drought or loss of nearby fertile land. With no humans living within these, what are now ruins, their settlements slowly were covered by sand and were untouched until the mid-1800s. These ruins would not receive official protection until 1923 when the national monument was established. &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiAztec_Ruins_National_Monument&amp;quot; rel&amp;quot;nofollow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiAztec_Ruins_National_Monument&amp;lt;a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&amp;quot; rel&amp;quot;nofollow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;" id="4854744915" latitude="36.834156" license="5" longitude="-108.000562" nbComments="0" rank="34" tags="newmexico aztec sanjuan" title="Aztec Ruins National Monument, Aztec, New Mexico" url_b="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4854744915_9dce9108f8_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" userid="75683070@N00" views="880" />

The site was declared &amp;amp;quot;Aztec Ruin National Monument&amp;amp;quot; on January 24, 1923, and with a boundary change it was renamed &amp;amp;quot;Ruins&amp;amp;quot; on July 2, 1928. As an historical property of the National Park Service the National Monument was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Aztec Ruins was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, as part of the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, on December 8, 1987. Anasazi settlements in North America started during the late 11th century and ran until around 1300. The Anasazi are believed to most likely have moved from these ruins into neighboring areas such as the present day Hopi and Navajo reserves and the pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. These relocations occurred due to drought or loss of nearby fertile land. With no humans living within these, what are now ruins, their settlements slowly were covered by sand and were untouched until the mid-1800s. These ruins would not receive official protection until 1923 when the national monument was established. &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiAztec_Ruins_National_Monument&amp;quot; rel&amp;quot;nofollow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiAztec_Ruins_National_Monument&amp;lt;a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&amp;quot; rel&amp;quot;nofollow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;" id="4854740737" latitude="36.835032" license="5" longitude="-108.000057" nbComments="0" rank="47" tags="newmexico aztec sanjuan" title="Aztec Ruins National Monument, Aztec, New Mexico" url_b="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4854740737_0b6043780c_b.jpg" username="Ken Lund" userid="75683070@N00" views="538" />

The dotted lines on the left are thought to be where walls once existed, but may have been scavenged for rock or fallen over time. The Salmon Ruins are named after the pioneer, Peter Milton Salmon, and his son George P. Salmon, who bought the land near the ruins in 1877, and built a homestead in 1900.

These mosaics are made with small, finely cut and polished stone pieces which have been fitted together without the use of mortar. - &amp;lt;a href&amp;quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiMitla&amp;quot; rel&amp;quot;nofollow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiMitla&amp;lt;a&amp;gt; Mitla - Archaeological Site, Mexico March 24, 2013" id="8688472757" latitude="16.920295" license="1" longitude="-96.35293" nbComments="0" rank="173" tags="photo ruins aztec mitla" title="DSC06022-E" url_b="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7046/8688472757_33ed31e04f_b.jpg" username="washuugenius" userid="92996378@N00" views="30" />

<photo  date_taken="2010-05-04 11:38:00" description="PLEASE, no multi invitations in your comments. DO NOT FEEL YOU HAVE TO COMMENT.Thanks. El Castillo was primarily built to represent Snake Mountain, the mystic place where creation first occurred in Mayan folklore. Snake mountain is a design practice adopted in Teotihuican as well as the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. Though brought to its full artistic maturity in Chichén Itzá, the design is much older than any of these cities. There are examples of the Snake Mountain design at Waxaktun and at Cerros as early as 100 BC. The upright bodies of the snakes that act as supports for the upper temple are meant to represent the &amp;amp;quot;Kuxan Sum&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;Living cord&amp;amp;quot; that connected the rulers of the earth with their gods. Nowhere in the Mayan world is there a larger or more impressive representation of the Snake Mountain design than in El Castillo, nor one with as much functionality. Snake Mountain was also where Xmucane, the first mother, used maize dough to mold the first humans at the beginning of the fourth creation. A small doorway on the west face of the northern stairs is the only access up a small stairway to the inner temple beneath. In this inner temple is another Chaac Mool and a jaguar throne, sealed off to tourists by an iron gate." id="4640150206" latitude="0" license="5" longitude="0" nbComments="45" rank="190" tags="travel mountain holiday mexico nikon ruins maya snake yucatan free chichenitza mayan dennis jarvis 2010 thecastle elcastillo d300 iamcanadian snakemountain 18200vr 70300mmvr dennisjarvis pyramidofkukulkan archer10 dennisgjarvis" title="Mexico-6004 - Snake Mountain" url_b="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4640150206_d2bee9d48c_b.jpg" username="archer10 (Dennis)" userid="22490717@N02" views="1730" />

Serpents and frogs at the Great Temple The importance of animals in Mexica ritual is evident in the Great Temple, both in the architecture and in the offerings deposited there. Different species of serpents were represented in architecture; their bodies were decorated with symbolic elements, such as feathers, rings, or spirals. On the four facades of the platform, there are monumental serpent heads carved of basalt. Two enormous serpent heads, each measuring 6m (20ft) long and with undulating bodies, flank the access to the platform. The serpent heads tenoned into the platform have been interpreted as images serving to evoke Coatepec hill, the place where Huitzilopochtli was born. A frog altar stands in the middle of the Stage IVb platform. The croaking of these amphibians announced the coming rains.

My photos are FREE for anyone to use, just give me credit and it would be nice if you let me know. Thanks Pyramid of the Moon, associated by the Aztecs with the moon and water goddess Chalchiuhtlicue. It is 46 meters high, divided into four massive tiers with a monumental south-facing stairway. The pyramid was constructed between 200 and 450 A.D. Tunnels dug into the structure have revealed that over a period of several hundred years, the pyramid underwent at least six facelifts and each new addition was larger and covered the previous structure. There is a tomb apparently made to dedicate the fifth phase of construction. It contains four human skeletons, animal bones, jewelry, obsidian blades, and a wide variety of other offerings. Archeologists estimated that the burial occurred between 100 and 200 A.D. Another tomb dedicated to Chalchiuhtlicue was discovered in 2007. It is dated to the fourth stage of construction. It contained a single human male sacrificial victim as well as a wolf, jaguar, puma, serpent, bird skeletons, and more than 400 other relics which include a large greenstone and obsidian figurines, ceremonial knives, and spear points.

The sign next to it reads: &amp;amp;quot;On this spot, Electric Company workers came upon the sculpture of the Goddess Coyolxhauhqui on February 21, 1978. The sculpture refers to the mythical battle between the socal powers of Huitzilpochtli and the nocturnal ones of the moon goddess, Coyolxhauhqui. This sculpture is one of the masterpieces of Mexica Culture, along with the Sun Stone, or Aztec Calendar, the Tizoc Stone, the Coatilcue, and the recently discovered Tlatecuhtli goddess. Originally brightly polychromed, the Coyolxhauhqui was placed at the foot of the stairs to the upper part of the temple, crowned by the sanctuaries dedicated to Huitzilopochtli side. In this way, the Templo Mayor became the place where major myths and all civil and religous power were brought together. Today the Coyolxhauhqui is exhibited inside the Templo Mayor Museum, whil a copy occupies its former location.&amp;amp;quot;" id="3952870058" latitude="19.434524" license="2" longitude="-99.131408" nbComments="0" rank="286" tags="vacation archaeology mexico mexicocity df aztec tuesday trips precolombian templomayor mexica mex prehispanic federaldistrict mexicocityzocalo archaeologicalruins christmasinmexico dfzocalo mexico2008 districofederal mexicotrip2008 12302009 tenocntitlan tenochtitlanarchaeologicalzone" title="Coyolxhauhqui Replica" url_b="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2542/3952870058_e6f0eb21cf_b.jpg" username="akseabird" userid="93752018@N00" views="360" />
